This repo (will) code and data from my RSIF publication: [*A dynamic dose–response model to account for exposure patterns in risk assessment: a case study in inhalation anthrax*](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/11/09/rsif.2010.0491)

The original analysis was done in Matlab and will recreated here in R.

If you can get through the paywall, here is a cool paper that references this work and compares to mechanistic Anthrax models:
